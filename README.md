# Model-Representation
This Python code snippet demonstrates a simple linear regression model applied to housing price prediction based on the size of the house. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Data Setup**: It sets up training data `x_train` (size in 1000 square feet) and `y_train` (price in 1000s of dollars) with two data points.

2. **Visualization**: It uses Matplotlib to visualize the training data points as a scatter plot, where the x-axis represents the size of the house, and the y-axis represents the price.

3. **Model Parameters**: It initializes the model parameters `w` (weight) and `b` (bias) to arbitrary values.

4. **Model Prediction**: It defines a function `compute_model_output` to compute the model's prediction for a given input `x`, weight `w`, and bias `b`. The prediction is based on a simple linear equation: `f_wb[i] = w * x[i] + b`.

5. **Model Visualization**: It plots the model prediction as a line on the same graph as the data points, showing how the model fits the training data.

6. **Prediction for Specific Input**: It demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the price for a specific input size (`x_i = 1.2`). This prediction is made by applying the model's equation with the learned parameters `w` and `b`.

Overall, this code provides a basic illustration of how to implement and visualize a simple linear regression model for predicting housing prices based on the size of the house. It's a foundational example commonly used in machine learning and serves as a starting point for more complex regression analyses.
